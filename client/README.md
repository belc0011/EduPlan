# EduPlan 504 Organizer

## About the Project

### Project Overview

The primary purpose of this project is to enable teachers to store and search the 504 accommodations their students have each year. They can create category names that make sense to them, filter the accommodations by category, search by key word (e.g., "test" or "notes"), and add comments to each accommodation (e.g., "student not currently using" or "modify to include both quizzes and tests"). These features help teachers with many students to strictly adhere to all of the many accommodations their individual students have with fidelity rather than continuously searching through stacks of papers going line by line each time they administer a test or create a seating chart, hunting for relevant accommodations.

1. Click the "Sign Up" button and create an account to sign in.
2. Click on the "Categories" button in the NavBar and then click on "New Category". Create all the categories you believe you will need.
3. Click on "Students" in the NavBar and then click on "ADD A STUDENT". Add as many students as you need.
4. For each student, you can click on their name to add an accommodation. In the text box that labeled "New accommodation description" enter the description of the accommodation, then select the category you would like the accommodation to be added to from the dropdown list. 
5. When you have feedback about the usefulness of an accommodation for a particular student, navigate to the student's page, click on the accommodation and then click on the "ADD COMMENT" button to leave a comment on that accommodation.
6. Use the "Categories" button from the NavBar if you want to pull up all accommodations in a particular category.
7. Use the "Accommodations" button from the NavBar if you want to be able to search accommodations by key word or phrase.
8. Comments, accommodations, categories and students can all be edited or deleted. Deleting a category will automatically remove all accommodations within that category.
